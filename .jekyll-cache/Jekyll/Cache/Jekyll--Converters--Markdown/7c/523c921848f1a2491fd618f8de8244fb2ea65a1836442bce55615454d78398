I"–<p><em>This is a periodic newsletter of the interesting things we‚Äôve seen and what we are thinking about in open source policy analysis.</em></p>

<p><strong>OSPC-incubated projects featured in Green New Deal analysis.</strong> In a recent AEI Economics Working Paper, AEI‚Äôs Aparna Mathur explores policy proposals to accomplish some of the stated goals of the Green New Deal. Mathur first advocates for a carbon tax as a means for achieving climate goals. She then explores possible solutions for raising revenues, reducing economic inequality, and increasing work incentives. Using Tax-Calculator,&ast; Mathur estimates revenue and distributional impacts of increasing the top marginal income tax rate, expanding the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, and introducing a universal basic income. Mathur then uses the Paid Family Leave Cost Model&ast; to estimate the cost implications of various paid family and medical leave scenarios, a policy mentioned in the Green New Deal. <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mathur-Green-New-Deal-WP-6.pdf">Link</a></p>

<p><strong>Test your doodling ability with artificial intelligence.</strong> To play ‚ÄúQuick, Draw!‚Äù you have 20 seconds to draw a doodle on your computer, and an open source neural network developed by Google tries to guess what you are drawing. The model is trained with a database of over 50 million doodles from users like you. See if the algorithm can recognize your doodles or contribute to the dataset with your own drawings. <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/">Link</a></p>

<p><strong>An unsurprising drop in charitable giving.</strong> A year ago, AEI‚Äôs Alex Brill and Derrick Choe used Tax-Calculator* to predict a decline in annual household charitable giving of $16.3 ‚Äì $17.2 billion as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act‚Äôs increased standard deduction. In a recent blog post, Brill and Choe compare their 2018 prediction to a new estimate from Giving USA, which reports a decline of $15.5 billion in household charitable giving over the past year. <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Charitable-Giving-and-the-Tax-Cuts-and-Jobs-Act.pdf">Link</a> and <a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/2018-charitable-giving-dips-as-predicted/">link</a></p>

<p><strong>The case against differential privacy.</strong> In a Twitter thread, Steven Ruggles (University of Minnesota) makes the case against differential privacy (DP), a new privacy formulation for the 2020 Census that we have discussed in this newsletter several times. Ruggles uses specific examples of DP-protected data to argue that DP may make tabular data unusable for most applications of small-area data ‚Äì such as drawing school boundaries or assessing racial segregation ‚Äì and is not appropriate or feasible for producing microdata. <a href="https://twitter.com/histdem/status/1147265434267336714?s=21">Link</a></p>

<p><strong>Open source software in self-driving cars.</strong> Tier IV, a Japanese startup that develops open source software for self-driving cars, recently raised over $100 million to facilitate commercialization of its technology. The software is already used by hundreds of companies, auto manufacturers, and government agencies. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/japanese-open-source-self-driving-startup-tier-iv-raises-over-100m-in-massive-series-a/">Link</a></p>

<p><strong>Policy Simulation Library (PSL) June newsletter.</strong> The monthly PSL* newsletter is complete with user highlights and model updates. <a href="https://www.pslmodels.org/Newsletter/archive.html">Link</a></p>

<p>&ast; These projects are attendees or graduates of OSPC‚Äôs incubator program.</p>
