### Everything we share is free and open source

The Open Source Policy Center is built on the principal that better public policy analysis leads to better public policy. Through the study and application of open source techniques for policy analysis, we aim to systematically improve the policymaking process by increasing the accuracy and accessibility of cutting edge models. This approach is based on the core belief that the way to optimize government is by carefully assessing policy options using transparent models and evidence-based assumptions, thereby enabling the free competition of ideas in this computer age. No matter your policy aims, the most honest and productive way to argue for them is through open, evidenced based and reproducible analyses. 

Since 2013, the Open Source Policy Center has advanced informed policy by working with the with the open source community to develop and share an open source framework for building policy analysis tools. We launched several open source projects like Tax-Calculator[^1], B-Tax[^2], C-TAM[^3], OG-USA[^4], and, most recently, the Policy Simulation Library[^5]. The models we launched have been used by economic policy staffers in Democratic and Republican Administrations, the tax-writing committees and subcommittees in Congress, Congressional leadership offices, national newspapers, primary and general election presidential campaigns, and dozens of university classes. 

In 2018, we are committed to convening the growing open source community and educating policymakers, modelers, and the public about open source policy analysis.
