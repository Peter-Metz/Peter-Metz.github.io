*This is a periodic newsletter of the interesting things we’ve seen and what we are thinking about in open source policy analysis.*

**Tax-Cruncher and Tax-Calculator used for analysis of households under
Joe Biden tax plan.** From Richard Rubin: "An analysis by The Wall
Street Journal and Kyle Pomerleau of the right-of-center American
Enterprise Institute looks more narrowly at how the Biden tax plan would
affect five sample
households." [Link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-bidens-tax-plan-might-affect-five-american-households-11599739200)

**Microdf project added to Policy Simulation Library (PSL).** Max Ghenis
from the [UBI Center](http://ubicenter.org/) has introduced his
microdf project to the PSL Catalog. Microdf is composed of analysis
tools for working with survey microdata as pandas DataFrames.

**Claremont McKenna professor releases a new web app based on The
Economist election model.** Professor Ric Fernholz and Dan Fernholz have
released a new visualization of various election scenarios based on
state-level outcomes. The data underlying the visualization is produced
by a variant of the current election model from The Economist.

**Open-source models of ocean wave dynamics.** Ocean modelers from the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the
University of Miami have open sourced their wave models: the NOAA
WAVEWATCH III and the University of Miami Wave Model. Both models are
primarily used to simulate the dynamic evolution of ocean waves in a
wide variety of environments, from still weather to hurricanes or
typhoons. [NOAA model](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3), [Miami
