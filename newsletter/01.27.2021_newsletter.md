*This is a periodic newsletter of the interesting things we’ve seen and what we are thinking about in open source policy analysis.*

**Tax-Brain\* used to analyze tax credits and marriage.** In a recent
report, Angela Rachidi from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) used
Tax-Brain to analyze how changes to the maximum income threshold for
receiving the Earned Income Tax Credit would affect the incomes of
married couples.

**“Demo Days” series at the Policy Simulation Library\* (PSL) features
OG-USA\* and microdf.** In the two latest PSL Demo Days, Rick Evans
demonstrates OG-USA using a simulation on Compute Studio, and Max Ghenis
demonstrates microdf using an example analysis on Google Colab.

**An open-source Pandas/NumPy-based framework for statistical
analysis.** A postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience from University of
California, Berkeley, has open-sourced Pingouin, a statistical analysis
framework in Python that is built to integrate seamlessly with Pandas
and NumPy. The package allows users to compute standard statistical
operations on Pandas dataframes and NumPy arrays.
