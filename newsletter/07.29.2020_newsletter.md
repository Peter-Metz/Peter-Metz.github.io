*This is a periodic newsletter of the interesting things we’ve seen and what we are thinking about in open source policy analysis.*

**New open-source unemployment benefits calculator and Becker Friedman Institute working paper.** Scholars with the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago have released an open-source unemployment benefits calculator alongside their [paper](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2020-62/) examining unemployment insurance during COVID-19. Ernie Tedeschi from Evercore ISI used this code to determine the distribution of individuals affected by the proposed legislation for unemployment relief.

**New York–based nursing service releases open-source contact-tracing app.** The Visiting Nurse Service of New York has created and released an open-source contact-tracing app designed for staff visits to patient homes.

**Ireland contributes contact-tracing app to the Linux Foundation.** Ireland’s public health organization, the Health Service Executive, has donated its [open-source contract-tracing app](https://github.com/covidgreen/covid-green-app) to Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH). LFPH will begin modifying both Ireland’s and [Canada’s open-source contract-tracing apps](https://github.com/CovidShield/rationale) to become compatible with the [Google Apple Exposure Notification System](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/), which was created to provide public health agencies with a framework for exposure notification on iOS and Android.

**Washington State University adopts open-access publishing model for computer science research.** Earlier this month, [we discussed](https://www.ospc.org/newsletter07012020/) an open-access publication deal between the University of California System and Spring Nature. Now, Washington State University has partnered with the Association for Computing Machinery to publish computer science research under open-access terms in the ACM’s Digital Library.
