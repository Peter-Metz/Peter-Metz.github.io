*This is a periodic newsletter of the interesting things we’ve seen and what we are thinking about in open source policy analysis.*

**“Demo Days” series at the Policy Simulation Library\* (PSL) features
Tax-Brain\* and Tax-Cruncher\*.** In the latest PSL Demo Day, Matt
Jensen demonstrates how to send a reform from one model to the other
using Compute Studio’s web API. [Link](https://youtu.be/0E_GawHQres)

**Niskanen Center releases analysis of Mitt Romney’s proposed Child
Allowance.** Samuel Hammond and Robert Orr from the Niskanen Center have
released an analysis of Mitt Romney’s proposed reforms for the Child Tax
Credit. The analysis uses public data from the Current Population Survey
and the Supplemental Poverty Measure and was assisted by
Tax-Calculator\*. [Link](https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Analysis-of-the-Romney-Child-Allowance_final.pdf)

**New Jersey court allows defendant to view source code of DNA testing
software.** An individual accused in a New Jersey shooting has been
allowed to view the source code of the MATLAB DNA testing software used
as evidence for his involvement in the shooting. [Link](https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/04/dna_testing_software/)

**An open-source tool for tracking carbon emissions of compute.** An
international consortium of machine learning and artificial intelligence
researchers have open-sourced CodeCarbon, a Python-based tool for
tracking the amount of carbon emissions produced during a given
computational operation. The software is capable of tracking emissions
from simple computing operations (e.g. sorting algorithms) or complex
operations (e.g. machine learning/optimization algorithms). [Link](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon)

***Nature* explores code & software consequential for science.** In a
recent article, *Nature* magazine explored 10 software codebases
produced between 1957 and today that have greatly impacted scientific
progress. Among the codesbases explored are the Fast Fourier Transform,
the BLAS linear algebra package, the arXiv preprint server and the
iPython/Jupyter Notebook. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00075-2)

\* These projects are attendees or graduates of OSPC’s incubator program.
