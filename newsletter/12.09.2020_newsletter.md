*This is a periodic newsletter of the interesting things we’ve seen and what we are thinking about in open source policy analysis.*

**OpenFisca-UK joins the Policy Simulation Library\* (PSL).** Nikhil
Woodruff from the UBI Center has added his OpenFisca-UK project to the
PSL catalog. OpenFisca-UK is a model of the United Kingdom’s tax system
based on the open-source [OpenFisca](https://openfisca.org/en/)
platform. [Link](https://github.com/PSLmodels/openfisca-uk)

**“Demo Days” series at the PSL\* features Cost-of-Capital
Calculator.\*** In the latest PSL Demo Day, Jason DeBacker demonstrated
the Cost-of-Capital Calculator using a simulation on Compute Studio. [Link](https://youtu.be/KLIuFbYPpNA)

**UBI Center** **estimates the welfare effects of child allowances using
open-source code.** The UBI Center has released a new report analyzing
the effect of child allowances on poverty and inequality within the US.
The report uses open-source code to simulate and visualize the effect of
monthly child allowances on the child poverty rate. [Link](https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/)

**Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) funds open-source projects.** In a
third cycle of funding (we discussed the second cycle in [June
2020](https://www.ospc.org/newsletter06032020/)**),** CZI announced
$4.7 million in funding for several open-source projects that the OSPC
and the Policy Simulation Library rely on, including NumPy, Pandas, and
Bokeh. [Link](https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/czi-awards-4-7-million-for-open-source-software-and-organizations-advancing-open-science/)

\* These projects are attendees or graduates of OSPC’s incubator program.
