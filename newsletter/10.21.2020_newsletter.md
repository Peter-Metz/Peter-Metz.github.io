*This is a periodic newsletter of the interesting things weâ€™ve seen and what we are thinking about in open source policy analysis.*

**AEI report on economic effects of Biden's tax plan.** In a new
report, Kyle Pomerleau (AEI) and Grant Seiter (AEI) used Tax-Calculator
and OG-USA to estimate the revenue, distributional, and macroeconomic
effects of Joe Biden's proposed tax policies.

**Hoover Institution study of Biden's proposed economic policies.**
Timothy Fitzgerald (Texas Tech University), Kevin Hassett (Hoover
Institution), Cody Kallen (University of Wisconsin), and Casey Mulligan
(University of Chicago) released a new report with the Hoover
Institution using Tax-Calculator and other models to analyze the
economic effects of a broad array of Biden's proposed fiscal and
regulatory policies.

**Brookings reports on investing in open-source technology.** A recent
Brookings Institution article by Frank Nagle (Harvard) argues that
federal investment in open-source technology is crucial for the American
economy and its technological infrastructure. Nagle claims past
investment in supercomputing paid significant dividends and that the
government should likewise support open-source technologies.

**Policy Simulation Library (PSL) is hosting its first demo day.** The
inaugural presentation will be on November 2 at 11:30 a.m. ET, with Matt
Jensen (AEI) demoing how to create policy reform files for use with
