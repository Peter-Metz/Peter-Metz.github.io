*This is a periodic newsletter of the interesting things we’ve seen and what we are thinking about in open source policy analysis.*

**PCI Outbreak\* releases working paper.** Authors of the Policy Change
Index (PCI) Outbreak have released a new working paper outlining the
project’s natural language processing algorithm and its results for data
from February to October 2020.

**“Demo Days” series at the Policy Simulation Library\* (PSL) features
Tax-Brain\*.** In the latest PSL Demo Day, Anderson Frailey demonstrates
Tax-Brain using a simulation on Compute Studio.

**Tweeting with Tax-Calculator\*.** In a recent tweet, Ernie Tedeschi
validates the impact of a $2,000 coronavirus relief check for households
on government expenditures.

**An open-source data compression module for the HDF5 format.** An
international group of researchers has open sourced Hickle, an
implementation of Python’s popular “pickle” data compression and
serialization module for the
[HDF5](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/about-hdf5)
data format. NumPy arrays, Pandas dataframes, and standard Python
objects such as lists and dictionaries can be saved to and loaded from
HDF5 files extremely quickly, and HDF5’s hierarchical structure allows
multiple datasets and objects to be stored in groups and subgroups in
one HDF5 file. [Link](https://github.com/telegraphic/hickle)

**Into city simulation? German Aerospace Center (GAC) open sources urban
mobility simulation software.** The Institute of Transportation Systems
at the GAC has open-sourced SUMO, a software package for simulating
intermodal traffic and public transport systems that interact with
pedestrians. [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo)

\* These projects are attendees or graduates of OSPC’s incubator program.
