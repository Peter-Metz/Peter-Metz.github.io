*This is a periodic newsletter of the interesting things we’ve seen and what we are thinking about in open source policy analysis.*

<p><strong>OSPC-incubated projects featured in Green New Deal analysis.</strong> In a recent AEI Economics Working Paper, AEI’s Aparna Mathur explores policy proposals to accomplish some of the stated goals of the Green New Deal. Mathur first advocates for a carbon tax as a means for achieving climate goals. She then explores possible solutions for raising revenues, reducing economic inequality, and increasing work incentives. Using Tax-Calculator,&ast; Mathur estimates revenue and distributional impacts of increasing the top marginal income tax rate, expanding the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, and introducing a universal basic income. Mathur then uses the Paid Family Leave Cost Model&ast; to estimate the cost implications of various paid family and medical leave scenarios, a policy mentioned in the Green New Deal. <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mathur-Green-New-Deal-WP-6.pdf">Link</a></p>

**Test your doodling ability with artificial intelligence.** To play “Quick, Draw!” you have 20 seconds to draw a doodle on your computer, and an open source neural network developed by Google tries to guess what you are drawing. The model is trained with a database of over 50 million doodles from users like you. See if the algorithm can recognize your doodles or contribute to the dataset with your own drawings.

**An unsurprising drop in charitable giving.** A year ago, AEI’s Alex Brill and Derrick Choe used Tax-Calculator* to predict a decline in annual household charitable giving of $16.3 – $17.2 billion as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act’s increased standard deduction. In a recent blog post, Brill and Choe compare their 2018 prediction to a new estimate from Giving USA, which reports a decline of $15.5 billion in household charitable giving over the past year.

**The case against differential privacy.** In a Twitter thread, Steven Ruggles (University of Minnesota) makes the case against differential privacy (DP), a new privacy formulation for the 2020 Census that we have discussed in this newsletter several times. Ruggles uses specific examples of DP-protected data to argue that DP may make tabular data unusable for most applications of small-area data – such as drawing school boundaries or assessing racial segregation – and is not appropriate or feasible for producing microdata.

**Open source software in self-driving cars.** Tier IV, a Japanese startup that develops open source software for self-driving cars, recently raised over $100 million to facilitate commercialization of its technology. The software is already used by hundreds of companies, auto manufacturers, and government agencies.
